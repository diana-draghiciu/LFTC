 #Lab2: 
 Symbol Table (you need to implement the data structure and required operations) using a hash table
 
 #Lab3:
 Implement a scanner (lexical analyzer): Implement the scanning algorithm and use ST from lab 2 for the symbol table.

Input: Programs p1/p2/p3/p1err and token.in (see Lab 1a)

Output: PIF.out, ST.out, message “lexically correct” or “lexical error + location”

Details:

ST.out should give information about the data structure used in representation

If there exists an error the program should give a description and the location (line and token)

#Lab4:
Write a program that:

1. Reads the elements of a FA (from file).

2. Displays its elements, using a menu: the set of states, the alphabet, all the transitions, the initial state and the set of final states.

3. For a DFA, verifies if a sequence is accepted by the FA.

grade = 10: Use FA to detect tokens <identifier> and <integer constant> in the scanner program

#Lab5:
Implement a parser algorithm: lr(0)
